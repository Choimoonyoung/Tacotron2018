# Tacotron2018
We implemented a Tacotron model. A Tacotron model is a speech synthesis model, which learns someone's voice through given inputs and synthesize the voice of the learned person with an input text. The model uses a lot of techniques like attention, TTS and so on... You can get more information of this model by the link of the paper below,

or our term project report.

We implemented this model while taking a Deep Learning Course 2019.
